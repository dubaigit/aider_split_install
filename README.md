# aider_split Usage Guide (Max 5 Concurrent Tasks)

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install globally
aider_split --setup-bin

# Run with 5 concurrent tasks
aider_split --max-concurrent 5 file1.py file2.py file3.py file4.py file5.py
```

## Writing fix_instructions.txt for Parallel Processing

### Example with 5 Concurrent Tasks:
```
1. Update user authentication (auth.py)
- Target: auth.py
- Location:
  * Class: Authentication
  * Method: verify_token, create_token
  * Add imports: from jwt import encode, decode
- Changes:
  * Implement JWT token handling
  * Add token expiration
  * Add refresh token logic
- Expected: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens

2. Enhance database models (models.py)
- Target: models.py
- Location:
  * Class: BaseModel
  * Method: __init__, save
  * Add imports: from sqlalchemy.sql import func
- Changes:
  * Add timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
  * Add soft delete functionality
  * Add schema validation
- Expected: Improved model with tracking

3. Implement caching (cache.py)
- Target: cache.py
- Location:
  * Class: CacheManager
  * Method: get_or_set
  * Add imports: from redis import Redis
- Changes:
  * Add Redis connection
  * Implement cache expiry
  * Add cache invalidation
- Expected: Redis-based caching system

4. Add API rate limiting (middleware.py)
- Target: middleware.py
- Location:
  * Class: RateLimiter
  * Method: check_limit
  * Add imports: import time, threading
- Changes:
  * Implement token bucket algorithm
  * Add user-based limits
  * Add burst handling
- Expected: Flexible rate limiting

5. Update logging system (logger.py)
- Target: logger.py
- Location:
  * Class: CustomLogger
  * Method: log_request
  * Add imports: import structlog
- Changes:
  * Add structured logging
  * Add request tracing
  * Add performance metrics
- Expected: Comprehensive logging system
```

### Tips for 5 Concurrent Tasks:
1. **File Independence**
   - Each task should work on different files
   - Avoid interdependent changes
   - Clearly specify file boundaries

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Each task gets its own aider instance
   - Monitor system resources
   - Consider memory usage

3. **Task Organization**
   ```
   Task 1 (auth.py):      Authentication changes
   Task 2 (models.py):    Database model updates
   Task 3 (cache.py):     Caching implementation
   Task 4 (middleware.py): Rate limiting
   Task 5 (logger.py):    Logging system
   ```

## Running Tasks

### Basic Command
```bash
aider_split --max-concurrent 5 *.py
```

### With Specific Files
```bash
aider_split --max-concurrent 5 auth.py models.py cache.py middleware.py logger.py
```

### Progress Display
```
==================== 游릭 STARTING TASK 1 ====================
[Auth updates running...]

==================== 游릭 STARTING TASK 2 ====================
[Model updates running...]

==================== 游릭 STARTING TASK 3 ====================
[Cache implementation running...]

==================== 游릭 STARTING TASK 4 ====================
[Rate limiting running...]

==================== 游릭 STARTING TASK 5 ====================
[Logging updates running...]
```

## Task Template for Each File

### Template Structure:
```
[task number]. [task title] ([filename])
- Target: [filename]
- Location:
  * Package: [package name]
  * Module: [module name]
  * Class: [class name]
  * Method: [method name(s)]
  * Section: [specific code section]
- Changes:
  * [detailed change 1]
  * [detailed change 2]
  * [detailed change 3]
- Dependencies:
  * Add: [new imports/requirements]
  * Remove: [old imports/code]
- Expected: [expected outcome]
```

## Efficiency Tips

1. **Parallel Planning**
   - Group related changes by file
   - Ensure changes don't conflict
   - Distribute work evenly

2. **Resource Management**
   - 5 concurrent tasks use more memory
   - Monitor system performance
   - Adjust if needed

3. **Error Handling**
   - Each task has isolated error handling
   - Failed tasks don't affect others
   - Easy to retry specific tasks

## Command Reference
